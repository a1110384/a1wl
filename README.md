# a1wl

A basic window/audio handling library for Windows only.

To use yourself just copy "a1wl.h" into your project or your includes folder, then include it in your c/c++ code.

It's mean't to be very barebones so you can build your own systems/applications using it easily without much overhead. Generally compiles to very small filesize (the example compiles to 14KB).
